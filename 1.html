    <h2>HTML</h2>
    <p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/" target="_blank" title="html5 specification">HyperText Markup
        Language or HTML</a> is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web
        browser. It defines <strong>content and structure of <u>web</u> content</strong>.
        It is often assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as
        JavaScript.Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into
        multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for
        its appearance.

      HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as
        interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents
        by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes, and other items.
        HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as <img> and <input> directly
        introduce content into the page. Other tags such as and surround and provide information about document text and
        may include sub-element tags. Browsers do not display the HTML tags but use them to interpret the content of the
        page.</p>

    <p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/" target="_blank" title="html5 specification"></a>HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which affects the behavior and
        content of web pages. The inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. The World Wide Web Consortium
        (W3C), former maintainer of the HTML and current maintainer of the CSS standards, has encouraged the use of CSS
        over explicit presentational HTML since 1997. A form of HTML, known as HTML5, is used to display video and
        audio, primarily using the canvas element, together with JavaScript.</p>
